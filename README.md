# VBA-challenge-2
VBA Bootcamp challenge 2 submission 

Background: 

In this assignment, I used Excel VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

Instructions:

(1) Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information: ticker symbol, quarterly change, percent change, and total stock volume.

(2) Add functionality to the script to return the stock with the greatest percent increase, decrease, and total stock volume 


Steps: 

(1) All worksheets were looped together using VBA script to ensure that the stock data would process through Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4

(2) Each variable was properly defined and columns were labeled, respectively. 

(3) The stock “tickers” were established and looped through the columns. Quarterly change, percent change and total stock volume were calculated and printed. Conditional formatting was used to established if a value was positive (green), negative (red), or neutral (none). 

(4) Values for greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume were set, defined, and calculated.
